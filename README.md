# Apache Kafka Chat System

Welcome to my **Apache Kafka Chat System**! 🎉  

This is a simple project where I'm diving into **Apache Kafka** to build a real-time messaging system. It’s a fun way to explore how Kafka works while creating something interactive. 🚀

## Why This Project?

This project is part of my journey to:

- **Learn how Apache Kafka works** in real-world applications.  
- **Build and understand real-time communication systems.**  
- **Experiment with hosting and deployment in the cloud** (coming soon!).  

---

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat with Kafka as the backbone!
- **Basic User Interface**: A straightforward interface to send and receive messages.

## What’s Next?  
Right now, everything is running locally, but I’m planning to take it to the **cloud** soon. 🌩️ Hosting it online will make it accessible from anywhere!
